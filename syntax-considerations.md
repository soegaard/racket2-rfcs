# Summary
[summary]: #summary

A collection of considerations for syntax design decisions.  This is an early draft; many changes are expected, both in amount of content and organization of information.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

To facilitate the discussion around syntactic principles by providing a record of considerations that have been brought up.  The intent is to be usable both as a checklist to help in discussing specific proposals and also as a starting point for developing and refining principles in the future.


# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Sample ways of using this list include:
* While developing a proposal, go through this list as a source of possible perspectives not considered
* Use terminology from this list to describe the tradeoffs of your proposal
* Add to this list if there appears to be a consideration in a syntax discussion that is not described here
* Suggest a reorganization of the list to clarify or illustrate concepts
* Explore an idea on this list with a proposal or more specific set of examples

# Considerations List
[considerations-list]: #considerations-list

* familiar expectations
  * US high school algebra
    * infix operators
    * algebra-style function notation
    * parens can be used for grouping
* flexible
* clean / not "noisy"
* dependent on advanced tooling/editor support
* easy to rearrange chunks of code
* distinctive
* tree resemblance
* uniformity vs texture
* macros / language extensions feel natural next to existing forms
* the syntax must lead to easy to use "syntax patterns" and "syntax templates" (important for macro writers)


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

* Do we need more guidance/exposition on the purpose and proposed usage of this document?
* As this document develops, should examples and more concrete metrics or elements be included or split into a different format?

Potentially relevant but outside the scope of this document:
* What are the goals of the Racket2 project?  Which barriers we are most interested in lowering may be part of the decision-making process.
* What will be the relationship between Racket2 and the existing #lang racket?


# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

* Define categories of considerations
* Provide guidelines?
* Refine into a discussion framework
